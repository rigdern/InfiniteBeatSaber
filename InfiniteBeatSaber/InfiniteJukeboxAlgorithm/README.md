# Infinite Jukebox Algorithm

The algorithm for the Infinite Jukebox which generates a never-ending and ever changing version of any song. Extracted from https://github.com/UnderMybrella/EternalJukebox/ and ported from JavaScript to C#.

For more information about this algorithm, see the repo [rigdern/InfiniteJukeboxAlgorithm](https://github.com/rigdern/InfiniteJukeboxAlgorithm).

## Credits
The original implementation of The Infinite Jukebox is by [Paul Lamere](https://musicmachinery.com/2012/11/12/the-infinite-jukebox/).

The code in this directory is derived from [The Eternal Jukebox by UnderMybrella](https://github.com/UnderMybrella/EternalJukebox/), a rework of the original project.

I published my extraction of the Infinite Jukebox algorithm to [its own repo](https://github.com/rigdern/InfiniteJukeboxAlgorithm) to make it easier for anyone that wants to make use of the algorithm in their own projects.

# Manual Installation

Here are the steps if you want to manually install the Infinite Beat Saber mod:

1. Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/rigdern/InfiniteBeatSaber/releases).
1. Unzip the release and drop `InfiniteBeatSaber.dll` into your Beat Saber's `Plugins/` folder. For example, mine is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Plugins`.
1. You'll also need to similarly manually install [SiraUtil](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil/releases) into your Beat Saber's `Plugins/` folder. Infinite Beat Saber relies on some functionality in `SiraUtil`.

You'll need to make sure that you have compatible versions of all of these things:
- Beat Saber
- Infinite Beat Saber mod
- SiraUtil

To determine this, you can check `manifest.json` for the version of Infinite Beat Saber you downloaded.

The "Manual Installation" section of [this Beat Saber Modding Group page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation) has general information about manually installing mods.
